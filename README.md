<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

`Image-mixer` is a NPM package that will help users to mix layers of images into a sigle file.
Currently only works in node, but it will work on browsers in a near future!

This library will also help users with the maths! If you assign a probability for each of your images or layers, it will tell you whats the probability or rareness of each of the generated images. (See usage section)

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install image-mixer
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

I will put an example here when all ready.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
