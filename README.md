<!-- About -->

[Image-mixer](https://github.com/danilobassi8/image-mixer/blob/master) is a NPM package that helps users to mix layers of images into a sigle file.
Currently only works in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), but it will work on browsers in a near future!

This library will also help users with the maths if you want! If you assign a probability for each of your images or layers, it will tell you what's the probability or rareness of each of the generated images. ([See the docs](#documentation))
